# FullStack BackEnd

🌍 Motivation

As a software engineer at a Fortune 500 company, I’ve had the privilege of watching real-world projects evolve from scratch into complex, large-scale systems. Along the way, our team faced countless challenges—from architecture design to scaling under real-world constraints—and refined a set of best practices through deep exploration and iteration.

In today’s software landscape, an increasing number of frontend and backend developers are transitioning into full-stack roles. They’re not just looking to learn new frameworks—they want to understand the entire development lifecycle and how systems work holistically.

That’s why I created Trip—a full-stack practice project inspired by real-world enterprise experience. It’s a sandbox where I apply real project architecture, patterns, and decision-making, and continue to iterate on it. My goal is to help more developers confidently grow into full-stack engineers with practical, production-grade thinking.
