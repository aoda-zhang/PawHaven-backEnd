# FullStack BackEnd

✨ What is this?

This project is a fullstack application built with NestJS (backend) and React (frontend), implementing a modular, scalable architecture with a clear separation of concerns.

It leverages a modern toolchain aligned with [roadmap.sh’s](https://roadmap.sh) recommended technologies to ensure high code quality, maintainability, and performance. The backend and frontend are fully decoupled yet seamlessly integrated for API communication and shared logic patterns.
